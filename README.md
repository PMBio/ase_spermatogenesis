## The dynamic genetic determinants of accelerated spermatid evolution

This repository contains all code to reproduce the results from our ASE-spermatogenesis paper. 

## Data availability

All data is available at ArrayExpress under the accession number E-MTAB-6934 (previously published B6 samples, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09182-1) and E-MTAB-11602 (everything else). This includes raw read files, total and allele-specific quantifications as well as filtered count matrices with cell type annotations. 

## Preprocessing

Scripts to perform allele-specific expression quantifications can be found in /Analysis/Alignments/. For standard processing of 10x single-cell RNA-Sequencing data, CellRanger was used with default settings. Further preprocessing scripts can be found in /Analysis/. 

## Analysis & Figures

All analysis scripts can be found in /Analysis/, including the figures they mainly refer to as well as scripts to reproduce all plots in the figures.
